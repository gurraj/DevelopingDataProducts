Developing Data Prododucts - CourseProject

This is a submission for Coursera: Developing Data Products- Course Project

MtCARS database is used to access information on the cars.

Dataset has been obtained from here and processed for the course project. This is the same file we used for the Cousera's Reproduciable Research Course.

A user may choose various options for a car from the database (transmission type, horsepower, displacement, and cylinders) and the data which corresponds to those choices will be displayed in a table.
